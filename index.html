					<h2>JOURNEY SO FAR</h2>
					<P class="content">
						My name is Abdullahi Suleiman Doma, I started learning web development
						when i was in federal polytechnic Bida.
						I first got influenced when i bought my laptop for the first time
						to the basic of web designing. At first it was hard to learn it because it wasn't
						how i imagined it could be, but thanks to my dedication and also listening to
						others advise i am now able to call myself a  JavaScript developer.
